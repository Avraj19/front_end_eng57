Client-side and server-side scripts
On a dynamic website there are client-side and server-side scripts. Client-side and server-side are sometimes referred to as front-end and back-end. The client-side of a website refers to the web browser and the server-side is where the data and source code is stored.

Client-side scripts
A client-side script is a program that is processed within the client browser. These kinds of scripts are small programs which are downloaded, compiled and run by the browser.

Server-side scripts
A server-side script is processed on the web server when the user requests information. These kinds of scripts can run before a web page is loaded. They are needed for anything that requires dynamic data, such as storing user login details.
